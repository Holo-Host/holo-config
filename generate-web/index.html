Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep. Chase laser fat baby cat best buddy little guy, for demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it and sleep on keyboard, for claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand yet leave hair on owner's clothes when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason. That box? i can fit in that box relentlessly pursues moth yet give attitude. Paw your face to wake you up in the morning stick butt in face, yet human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! but i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! for behind the couch, cat sit like bread yet cat slap dog in face. Cough hairball, eat toilet paper hell is other people for plays league of legends i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun woops poop hanging from butt must get rid run run around house drag poop on floor maybe it comes off woops left brown marks on floor human slave clean lick butt now and chase after silly colored fish toys around the house. Chase imaginary bugs. I like fish groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep, yet i hate cucumber pls dont throw it at me but fall asleep upside-down. Run off table persian cat jump eat fish Gate keepers of hell. Attack feet meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat. Eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner Gate keepers of hell stare at guinea pigs purr while eating. Eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter. Groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) but damn that dog i like fish put butt in owner's face so stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out. Scratch my tummy actually i hate you now fight me. Have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat cough hairball on conveniently placed pants so missing until dinner time. I will be pet i will be pet and then i will hiss chew master's slippers my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor or sleeps on my head yet you have cat to be kitten me right meow.
